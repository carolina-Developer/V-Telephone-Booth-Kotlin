Telephone booth
This project is a basic simulation of a telephone booth using object-oriented programming. The objective is to create a model that allows to make calls, calculate their cost and display the information related to them.

Characteristics
Call: Main class that represents a phone call. It contains properties such as the type of call, destination number, duration and cost of the call.
Call Types: Allows to differentiate between local, national and international calls.
Cost Calculation: The cost of the call is calculated based on the type of call and duration.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

src/: Contains the source code of the project.
Call.kt: Class that defines the structure of a call and the methods to calculate its cost.
Cabina.kt: Class that simulates the phone booth, allowing to make and register calls.
TipoLlamada: Class that establishes the types of calls and their rates.
GestionLlamadas: Class in charge of registering the information of all the booths.

README.md: Project documentation file.

Prerequisites
Kotlin: Kotlin installed in the system.
